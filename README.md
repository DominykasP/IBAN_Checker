# IBAN_Checker

A program that works in two modes:
1. Interactive checking of IBAN numbers. The user is asked to enter the account number and the program checks whether the number is correct.
2. Checking IBAN numbers from a text file. The user is asked to select the file. The program then scans the file and checks the account numbers. Results are outputed to the same name file with the extension .out.
